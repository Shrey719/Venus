# Overview 
Venus uses honeypot pages to trap scrapers in a tarpit. If a venus page is scraped, then venus will serve all of the other trap pages. 

# Structure 
Each doc/explanation is mirrored to where it is in the codebase. For example, /src/lib/tarpit/tar.js will corespond to /docs/src/lib/tarpit/tar.js.md
