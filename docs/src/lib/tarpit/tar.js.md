# Route generation
Route generation is done by a catch all so that if anything past the prefix is visited, it is valid*, and then random routes are genertaed

*this is soon to change so scrapers cant detect it

# Why the meta? 
In theory, the meta should help increase the value of the page at first glance, so when it is scraped it must be analyzed by something more expensive 

# Page structure? 
The page is structured similar to what a real site should be structured as, to increase the value until text is extracted, to bump the prices of an attacker

# Javascript to waste cpu cycles 
The reasoning for this is to introduce a minimal cost into the CPU, if the attacker dares to enable javascript    
I hope putting Math.sqrt(2) will be a big ol pain in the ass among other things, we will see
