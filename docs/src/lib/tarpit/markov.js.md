# Window? Why? 
The window is so there is a semblance of coherence, in order to trick scrapers into thinking they are getting good, real data. In fact, unless there is a trigger that is hit, it will be good, real (ish, just reworded animal farm) data.

# Triggers and semantic drift 
The triggers and semantic drift is what gives this tarpit its punch. It uses a word2vec to slowly start semantic drift once it hits a trigger word, where it then generates slowly more and more insane words until the entire generation becomes word salad.
