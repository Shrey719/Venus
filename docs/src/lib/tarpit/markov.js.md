# Window? Why? 
The window is so there is a semblance of coherence, in order to trick scrapers into thinking they are getting good, real data. In fact, unless there is a trigger that is hit, it will be good, real (ish, just reworded animal farm) data.

# Triggers and semantic drift 
If a trigger token is hit, then all of the text will slowly become insane, which is why the tarpit actually works instead of just being annoying
